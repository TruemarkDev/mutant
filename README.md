## What is Mutant?

An automated code review tool, with a side effect of producing semantic code coverage
metrics.

Think of mutant as an expert developer that simplifies your code while making sure that all tests pass.

That developer never has a bad day and is always ready to jump on your PR.

Each reported simplification signifies either:

A) A piece of code that does more than the tests ask for.
   You can probably use the simplified version of the code. OR:

B) If you have a reason to not take the simplified version as it violates a requirement:
   There was no test that proves the extra requirement. Likely you are missing an
   important test for that requirement.

On extensive mutant use A) happens more often than B), which leads to overall less code enter
your repository at higher confidence for both the author and the reviewer.

BTW: Mutant is a mutation testing tool, which is a form of code coverage.
But each reported uncovered mutation is actually a call to action, just like a flag in a code review
would be.

## Getting started:

* Start with reading the [nomenclature](/docs/nomenclature.md). No way around that one, sorry.
* Then select and setup your [integration](/docs/nomenclature.md#integration), also make sure
  you can reproduce the examples in the integration specific documentation.
* Use mutant during code reviews and on CI in [incremental](/docs/incremental.md) mode.
* Do not merge code with new alive mutations. If you really must bypass:
  Add the subjects with open problems to the ignored subjects.

## Operating Systems

Mutant is supported and tested under Linux and Mac OS X.

## Ruby Versions

Mutant supports multiple ruby versions at different levels:

* Runtime, indicates mutant can execute on a specific Ruby Version / implementation.
* Syntax, depends on Runtime support, and indicates syntax new to that Ruby version can be used.
* Mutations, depends on Syntax support, and indicates syntax new to that Ruby version is being analysed.

Supported indicates if a specific Ruby version / Implementation is actively supported. Which means:

* New releases will only be done if all tests pass on supported Ruby versions / implementations.
* New features will be available.

| Implementation | Version        | Runtime            | Syntax             | Mutations          | Supported          |

Mutant, as published in the opensource version, would not exist without the help
of [contributors](https://github.com/mbj/mutant/graphs/contributors) spending lots
of their private time.

Additionally, the following features where sponsored by organizations:

* Mutant's initial concurrency support was sponsored by an undisclosed company that does
  currently not wish to be listed here.
